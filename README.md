# MB.io - SINFO Test Drive Challenge API (backend)

We, at Mercedes-Benz.io build customer focussed products. These products go from the site that sells our cars to the applications that control and monitor them.

One of the web applications that we built for our customers is **Test Drive**. It allows a customer to book a test drive on a vehicle and dealer of his choice, simplifying the whole process for him.

Taking that into account, we challenge you to try to build a similar service. By creating a Test Drive (TD) backend application, your challenge is to consider that clients want to book test drives and you ought to match them with the available vehicles on Mercedes-Benz dealers.

On the business side, it's simple. Usually, customers choose a vehicle with a given set of attributes (fuel type, transmission, etc) and then they choose a retailer near them, booking the vehicle for an available time slot.

We provided you with [sample data](https://github.com/mercedesbenzio/SINFO-backend-challenge/blob/master/dataset.json) to make your task easier. This sample data is composed of:
  - a collection of dealers;
    - each dealer contains a set of vehicles that are available on its dealership;
    - each vehicle presents its own set of attributes (eg: model, fuel type, transmission type and days of the week that it's available for a test drive).
  - a collection of already scheduled bookings.

## The challenge

We expect that you build a Restful API that should implement the following features:

- List all vehicles by:
    - Model
    - Fuel type
    - Transmission
    - Dealer
- Find the closest dealer according to my location that has a vehicle with specific attributes (Model, Fuel Type, Transmission) [returns zero or one dealer]
- Create a new booking (Once a booking is made you can't double book a vehicle for that time slot)
- Cancel a booking (giving a reason for cancelation)

Download the sample data [dataset.json](https://github.com/mercedesbenzio/SINFO-backend-challenge/blob/master/dataset.json) for the challenge.

## Improvement suggestions:

- Find the dealers sorted by distance according to my location that have a vehicle with specific attributes (Model, Fuel Type, Transmission) [returns any number of dealers]
- Find the dealers inside a given polygon that have a vehicle with specific attributes (Model, Fuel Type, Transmission) [returns any number of dealers]

## Requirements:

- At MB.io our stack is Java and maven for dependency management but you are free to choose any open source language/tool you want.
- Load provided data (dealers, vehicles and existing bookings) at application startup.
- Your application should not depend on any external datasource (eg: databases, servers, etc.). Everything should run in memory.
- You are free to use any framework you think appropriate.
- Implement Unit Tests (we don't expect 100% coverage, use your best judgement).
- Submit a README file with your solution, with the following content:
    - How to build and run your application
    - How to run your tests
    - API documentation
    - Explanation about your choices, their limitations and possible improvements
    - Any additional information you may think is relevant
